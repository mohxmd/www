# Welcome to My Blog!

Hello, world! üëã

Welcome to my blog, where I'll be sharing my knowledge and experiences with
programming and technology. Whether you're an experienced developer or just starting your journey
in the world of programming, this blog is for you!

## About Me

Before we dive into the tech stuff, let me introduce myself. I'm Mohammed,
a passionate programmer and tech enthusiast. I've been working in the tech industry for `$`
years and have had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you can expect to find a wide range of topics related to programming and technology.
I'll be covering programming languages, frameworks, libraries, best practices, coding tips,
and much more. My goal is to create informative and beginner-friendly content that will help
you level up your skills and stay updated with the latest trends in the tech world.

    **Step 1: Say Hello to Code üëã**  
    Every great journey begins with a simple ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù.  
    In my posts, we‚Äôll start small ‚Äî printing text, understanding syntax, and learning how things work.
  </Stepper.Step>

<Stepper.Step>
  **Step 2: Explore the Tools üß∞** From editors to frameworks, I‚Äôll guide you through the essential
  tools every developer should know ‚Äî without the confusion.
</Stepper.Step>

<Stepper.Step>
  **Step 3: Build and Break üß±** We‚Äôll create projects, test them, break them, and rebuild them ‚Äî
  because that‚Äôs how real learning happens.
</Stepper.Step>

  <Stepper.Step>
    **Step 4: Grow with the Community üå±**  
    Programming is not a solo adventure. Together, we‚Äôll share knowledge, contribute to open source, and grow stronger.

### Keyboard Inputs

To open the developer tools in Chrome, press <kbd>F12</kbd>.

### Superscript and Subscript

- E=mc<sup>2</sup>
- H<sub>2</sub>O

## Fun with Code

Now, let's have some fun with code! Here's a classic "Hello, World!" example in Python and JavaScript:

### Python

```python title="main.py"
print("Hello, World!")
```

### JavaScript

```js title="hello.js" showLineNumbers{5}
console.log("hewwo"); // [!code --]
console.log("hello"); // [!code ++]
console.log("goodbye");
```

```js title="App.js" /age/#v /name/#v /setAge/#s /setName/#s /50/#i /"Taylor"/#i
const [age, setAge] = useState(50);
const [name, setName] = useState("Taylor");
```

### Lets code a for loop in C++

In this tutorial, we will loop through a for loop and print out the values of i

```cpp title="loop.cpp"
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  std::cout << i << std::endl;
}
```

Aren't they hilarious? üòÑ
